To train:

To output saliency maps:
```
python saliency_map.py
```

The repository contains the following:
- _src_ contains the necessary python files used to train the algorithm. Follow the instructions above to run. 
- _model_samples_ contains model checkpoints for the easy and hard conditions each trained on egocentric only, allocentric only and combined perspective.
- _visuals_ contains the necessary files to generate saliency maps using the model checkpoints
